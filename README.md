## Advanced Programming

These are some of my codes related to Advanced Programming Course.

At the following you can find the steps needed to create a repository and pushing your projects using **`git`** and **Visual Studio Code**.

- Create a directory on the local file system.
- Create a repo on GitHub.
- Select Clone "Clone or download" on GitHub, copy the link
- In Visual Studio Code, select `File` -> `Add Folder to Workspace` -> Select the newly created directory
- Select Terminal Window, type:
  - `git config --global user.name <github userID>`
  - `git clone <URL from github link copied earlier>`
    - for example for this repo: 
    * `git config --global user.name mamintoosi`
    * `git clone https://github.com/mamintoosi/cpp.git`
- File/Open Folder, open cpp folder and create a new file:
  - `CPP [WSL]` new file, create `helloworld.cpp`
- On Terminal, commit and push your changes:
  - `git commit -m "First commit"`
  - `git push -u origin master`
    * enter your user and passwords
- Now you have `helloworld.cpp` on your GitHub repository :)

After that I added this Readme to repository from GitHub web.
